Rerolling ARMOR items at the tinkerer is now possible
Fixed LOAD errors for characters (would often display a different mod, this mod was the culprit)
Fixed broken tooltips (such as +infinite mana)
Tooltips are now split from modifiers. This means the regular tooltip is showing only the bonuses received by the prefix of the item.
Fixed modifiers giving bonus crit and velocity
Illegitimate rolls are now automatically removed, this is mostly to fix load errors for players
Clarified DamageWithManaCost modifier tooltip "but added mana cost" => "but adds +{_manaCost} mana cost"
Clarified VelocityPlus modifier tooltip "velocity" => "projectile velocity"
